This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn install`

Installs all the dependencies

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Choices

I have decided to follow the Duck pattern for React/Redux so you'll see each components (features) containing a duck folder for a better structure and use of the Redux flow.
